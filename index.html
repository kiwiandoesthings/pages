                Heallo. This is the center for all my stuff, and where you can find my contacts. I don't know why anyone would need this, but I was bored, and might as well. So it's here.
                I already had a site like this previously, BUT I HAD MY FULL NAME AS THE COMMIT AUTHOR SO I DELETED THAT ONE (and realized I didn't have a code backup).
                
                Anyways, what I like about this site, is that you don't even need to be able to read to know it's mine. You'll know it's my site as soon as you see how much I overuse the border-radius CSS style.

                Took way too long to get the ascii art above working.

                I might add a blog soon.

                I'm not good at web design!!!!!!! But I do like box shadows. And funky transitions. So that makes up for it. Probably. Anyways, I did fix the broken navbar so aren't you proud of me.

                <strong>The repo for this website is not here for reasons. Valid ones. Can't tell you though.</strong>
